# Task 5: Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark

## 📌 Objective
Capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark to understand how different internet protocols operate and interact.

## 📦 Files Included
- `network_capture.pcap` – The packet capture file generated using Wireshark
- `report.md` – A summary of the captured traffic and protocol analysis

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Wireshark (Version 4.x)
- Windows 10 with Wi-Fi interface

## 🔍 Protocols Identified
- DNS
- TCP
- HTTP
- ICMP

## 🚀 Steps Followed
1. Installed Wireshark.
2. Started packet capture on active Wi-Fi interface.
3. Generated network traffic by browsing and pinging.
4. Applied filters for analysis (`http`, `dns`, `tcp`, `icmp`).
5. Exported the capture as a `.pcap` file.
6. Wrote a detailed protocol analysis report.

## 📤 Submission
Please find the `.pcap` and report in this repository. Submit the GitHub link using the provided Google Form.
